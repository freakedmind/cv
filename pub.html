<h3>Improving the performance of a continuous
bipolar-mode electrocoagulation (CBME) system,
treating a marigold flower processing wastewater,
through process modifications</h3>
<p>The present study focusses on improving the performance of a Continuous 
Bipolar Mode Electrocoagulation (CBME) system for removal of recalcitrant 
total organic carbon (TOC) and total phosphorus (TP) from a marigold flower 
processing wastewater (MWW). The process optimization on a basic configuration 
of CBME system was carried out as the first step. Studies to further enhance 
the performance were carried out. CBME technology, when applied in series 
configuration (as modular system) showed higher removal of TOC (87%) and 
TP (95%) compared to the other approaches. Micro pollutant analysis was 
carried out which resulted in complete removal of pollutants after treatment.</p>
